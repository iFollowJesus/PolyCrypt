# PolyCrypt
## Polyalphabetic Cipher Implementation in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of a polyalphabetic cipher, a classic encryption technique that uses multiple substitution alphabets to obscure the relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext. The program defines a PolyAlphaCipher class that generates a randomized polyalphabetic table and implements both encryption and decryption methods.

## Key Features:

* Dynamic Alphabet Generation: The cipher table is generated dynamically, ensuring a unique encryption pattern for each run.
* Customizable Alphabet Support: Supports encryption and decryption with a customizable alphabet set, allowing for varied applications.
* Encryption and Decryption: Includes methods for both encrypting and decrypting text, demonstrating the full cycle of cryptographic communication.

This project is a demonstration of applied cryptography principles and is suitable for educational purposes, showcasing the effectiveness of classical encryption methods in modern programming.
